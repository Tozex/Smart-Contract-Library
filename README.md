# Tozex Smart Contracts

## Smart Contracts that are used in Tozex Launchpad

The development of a smart contract code requires deep expertise in computer science, cryptography, and programming languages. The development must be accurate and optimized because each piece of code has an impact on cost execution and security. Rigorous testing and prototyping must be done before deploying a tradable token contract for crowdfunding or distribution.

Tozex library is open source, allowing anyone to check, audit, and contribute to our development. The first programming language of our library is based on Solidity to allow for deployment first on the Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), RootStock (RSK) and Binance Smart Chain blockchain networks. 

Deploying a smart contract (STO, ICO, or BRO) through our interface is very simple. The user can use his existing wallet (hardware or software wallet) through the Tozex platform to deploy the selected contract within the blockchain network of his choice without compromising his private key.
